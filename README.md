# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-and-Decryption-in-C
This program encrypts and decrypts a message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The user enters a message and a shift value, and the program applies the cipher. The encrypted message is then printed, and the program decrypts the message and prints it again. This implementation uses the C programming language.
